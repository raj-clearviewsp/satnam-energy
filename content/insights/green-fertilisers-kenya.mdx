# Green Fertilisers in Kenya

## Executive Summary

This study evaluates the feasibility of developing green ammonia production in Kenya to address both domestic fertilizer needs and energy security concerns. We analyze the economics, infrastructure requirements, and policy frameworks necessary for a sustainable green fertilizer industry.

## Context: Kenya's Fertilizer Challenge

Kenya imports over 90% of its fertilizer, creating significant exposure to global market volatility and supply chain disruptions. This dependency has several negative consequences:

1. **Food security risks** when global supply chains are disrupted
2. **Trade imbalance** with fertilizer imports exceeding $450 million annually
3. **Currency exposure** as fertilizers must be purchased with foreign exchange
4. **Price volatility** for farmers, reducing agricultural productivity

## Green Ammonia Opportunity

Green ammonia production could transform Kenya's agricultural input market by:

- Creating domestic fertilizer production capacity
- Utilizing abundant renewable energy resources
- Reducing import dependency and improving food security
- Creating new industrial jobs and expertise
- Building climate-resilient agricultural systems

## Technical Analysis

Our technical assessment shows promising potential for green ammonia production in Kenya, particularly leveraging the country's excellent renewable energy resources:

### Renewable Energy Resources

Kenya possesses world-class renewable energy resources that could power green ammonia production:

- **Geothermal**: 10+ GW potential in the Rift Valley with capacity factors exceeding 90%
- **Solar**: 4.5-6.5 kWh/mÂ²/day irradiation levels across much of the country
- **Wind**: Excellent resources in Turkana (capacity factors >45%) and coastal regions

### Production Economics

## Policy Recommendations

To enable green ammonia production in Kenya, we recommend a comprehensive policy framework:

1. **Renewable energy integration** - Dedicated renewable capacity with priority grid access for green ammonia facilities
2. **Financial incentives** - Production tax credits of $200/tonne for the first 5 years of operation
3. **Concessional financing** - Blended finance instruments to reduce capital costs and attract private investment
4. **Offtake guarantees** - Government procurement of green fertilizer at favorable rates for smallholder farmer subsidy programs
5. **Technical assistance** - Support for knowledge transfer and workforce development

## Implementation Roadmap

We propose a phased approach to developing Kenya's green ammonia industry:

### Phase 1: Pilot Project (2025-2027)
- 10,000 tonne/year demonstration facility
- Integrated with existing geothermal power
- Agricultural extension program for efficient fertilizer use

### Phase 2: Commercial Scale-up (2028-2030)
- 100,000 tonne/year commercial production
- Dedicated renewable energy capacity
- Regional export capabilities

### Phase 3: Full Industry Development (2031-2035)
- Multiple facilities totaling 500,000 tonnes/year
- Integration with comprehensive agricultural inputs strategy
- Potential for green shipping fuel export markets

## Conclusion

Green fertilizers represent a transformative opportunity for Kenya to address agricultural productivity, energy security, and climate goals simultaneously. With the right policy framework and investment approach, Kenya could become a regional leader in green ammonia production, creating substantial economic, food security, and environmental benefits.
