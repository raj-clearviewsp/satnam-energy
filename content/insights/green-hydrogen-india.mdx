# Green Hydrogen Cost Pathways in India

## Executive Summary

India has set ambitious targets for green hydrogen production, aiming for 5 million tonnes of annual capacity by 2030. This report analyzes the economic viability of green hydrogen production in India, examining key cost drivers, optimal deployment regions, and policy frameworks needed to achieve cost parity with grey hydrogen by 2030.

## Key Findings

Our analysis identifies several critical factors influencing green hydrogen economics in India:

1. Renewable electricity costs represent 60-70% of green hydrogen production costs
2. Electrolyzer CAPEX is expected to decline by 40-60% by 2030
3. Policy support can accelerate cost parity by 3-5 years

## Regional Analysis

India's diverse geography offers varying advantages for green hydrogen production. Our regional analysis identifies several promising areas:

### Gujarat

Gujarat offers excellent solar resources coupled with port access for export potential and industrial demand centers. The Kutch region shows particular promise with solar capacity factors exceeding 25%.

### Rajasthan

Rajasthan's exceptional solar resource (1800-2000 kWh/m²/year) provides the lowest potential renewable electricity costs, though water scarcity and transmission infrastructure represent key challenges.

### Tamil Nadu

Tamil Nadu offers a complementary mix of wind and solar resources, reducing the need for battery storage and improving electrolyzer utilization rates.

## Policy Recommendations

To accelerate green hydrogen adoption in India, we recommend several policy interventions:

1. **Production-linked incentives** offering ₹50/kg for the first five years of project operation
2. **Renewable electricity waivers** eliminating transmission charges for dedicated renewable capacity
3. **Capex subsidies** covering 30% of electrolyzer and balance of plant costs
4. **Demand creation** through mandatory green hydrogen purchase obligations in refineries and fertilizer production

## Conclusions

India has the potential to become a global leader in green hydrogen production, with costs potentially falling below $2.50/kg by 2030 with appropriate policy support. Strategic investments in electrolyzer manufacturing, renewable energy capacity, and transmission infrastructure can position India as a major hydrogen exporter while decarbonizing domestic heavy industry.
